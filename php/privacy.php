<dd><strong>Web beacons</strong>&nbsp;- Web beacons (also known as Pixel Tags) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring information, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (uniform resource locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.</dd>
<dt>2.5.</dt>
<dd><strong>IP Address</strong>&nbsp;- An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in the Internet. We store the IP address only, if it is necessary to provide a service or if may be legally necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<p>3.</p>
<p><strong>Essential information for data processing and security</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>3.1.</dt>
<dd>We will process personally identifiable data within the scope of the law and not without your required further consent only to the extent necessary for the conclusion and execution of our contractual relationship.</dd>
<dt>3.2.</dt>
<dd>We take organizational, contractual and technical security measures to ensure that the provisions of data privacy laws are complied with and, as a result, the data managed by us is protected from accidental or intentional manipulations, loss, destruction or access by unauthorized persons. These security measures are monitored on a regular basis and updated according to industry standard as necessary.</dd>
<dt>3.3.</dt>
<dd>If, within the framework of this Privacy Policy, contents, tools or other means and mediums are used by other providers (hereinafter referred to collectively as &ldquo;Third-party Providers&rdquo;) and whose registered office is abroad, it is assumed that a data transfer to the countries where those registered offices of the Third-party Providers are located takes place. The transmission of data to third-party countries is either based on legal authorization, user consent or specific clauses in the contract, which provide for legally required data security.</dd>
</dl>
<p>4.</p>
<p><strong>Processing of personal data</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>4.1.</dt>
<dd>Personal data, in addition to the use expressly named in this agreement and allowed by law, is used for the following purposes:
<ul>
<li>The provision, maintenance, security and execution of our Service;</li>
<li>Ensuring effective customer Service and technical support</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registration through authentication services of third parties</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>5.1.</dt>
<dd>Users can register and log in by using authentication services of Third-party Providers, as far as these are available (hereinafter referred to as &bdquo;authentication by a third-party&ldquo;). Particularly Facebook, Google or Twitter can be possible authentication service providers.</dd>
<dt>5.2.</dt>
<dd>As requirement for the authentication through a Third-party Provider, users should be registered at the respective Third-party Provider and enter the necessary login details in the appropriate web formula or should be already logged in to the Third-party Provider.</dd>
<dt>5.3.</dt>
<dd>In the context of a registration, we receive a user ID with the information under which the user with this user ID is logged in and an ID that cannot be further used by the Service Provider (so called &ldquo;user handle&rdquo;). Whether we receive further data depends only on the user who uses the authentication by a Third-party Provider, the data that is selected to be released in the context of the authentication, and which data has been authorized by the user in the privacy or other settings of the user account at the Third-party Provider. The data can differ, depending on the provider and the selections of the user; normally these are the e-mail address and the user name. In case of Facebook, this is also the - so called - Public Profile Information, that can be seen by everyone. This includes the name, profile and cover picture, gender, networks (i.e. school or working place), user name (Facebook URL) and user identification number (Facebook ID).</dd>
<dt>5.4.</dt>
<dd>The password that has been entered in the context of the authentication by a Third-party Provider cannot be seen by us, neither can it be saved by the Service Provider.</dd>
<dt>5.5.</dt>
<dd>The users are asked to keep in mind that their data, which we save, can be compared and synchronized with their user account at the Third-party Provider automatically. There is no obligation however for us to update the data.</dd>
<dt>5.6.</dt>
<dd>In the case that users decide that they do not wish to further use the connection of their user account at the Third-party Provider for the authentication by a Third-party Provider, they must cancel this connection within their user account at the Third-party Provider. If the users wish to delete their data we save, they must cancel their account at our Service.</dd>
<dt>5.7.</dt>
<dd>During the use of authentication by a third party, the users are asked to keep in mind the applicable Terms of Use, as well as the Rules for Data Use of the third party.

<p><strong>Browser notifications</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>9.1.</dt>
<dd>We enable users to obtain information about our Service and its contents through messages that are shown by their browsers (so called &bdquo;push notifications&rdquo;). In order to do this, we currently use the services provided by OneSignal Inc., 201 San Antonio Rd #140, Mountain View, CA 94040, USA.</dd>
<dt>9.2.</dt>
<dd>The push notifications are set up with the users&rsquo; consent and the users&rsquo; browser must support such push notifications. In order to be able to display push notifications, OneSignal is required to store an identifying feature of the browser, which is then used for push notifications only.</dd>
<dt>9.3.</dt>
<dd>Users can find more information about push notifications in OneSignal&rsquo;s privacy policy:&nbsp;<a href="https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtZwJ9vLd9-eI1BcU40-6s6gWiKg">https://onesignal.com/<wbr />privacy_policy</a>.</dd>

<p><strong>Google Analytics and User ID</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>10.1.</dt>
<dd>We use Google Analytics, a Google Inc. (&bdquo;Google&ldquo;) web analysis service. Google uses cookies, text files that are saved on users' computers and allow the use of our Service to be analyzed. The information generated on the user's use of our Service by the cookie is generally transferred to a Google server in the US where it is saved.</dd>
<dt>10.2.</dt>
<dd>We also use the function User ID in order to track data on user interaction with our Service. This User ID is anonymized and encrypted and will be except for its pseudonymous use not be processed with other data of a user in a way that makes the user identifiable.</dd>
<dt>10.3.</dt>
<dd>Google will use this information on our behalf in order to assess users' use of our Service, in order to compile reports on the activities within our Service and in order to render additional services for us associated with the use of our Service and Internet use.</dd>
<dt>10.4.</dt>
<dd>We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that Google shortens user IP addresses within an EU member state or in other contractual states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the US where it is shortened.</dd>
<dt>10.5.</dt>
<dd>We use the Analytics features for remarketing, Google Display Network impressions, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and Google Analytics reports on demographics and user interests. You can prevent Google from using Google Analytics for display ads and customize ads on the Google Display Network at:<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.google.com/settings/ads&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIUxxtgihxWlD10K2iOFCNBrDDEQ">https://www.google.com/<wbr />settings/ads</a>.</dd>
<dt>10.6.</dt>
<dd>The IP address transferred by the user's browser is not linked to other Google data. Users can prevent cookies being saved through the appropriate setting on their browser software; users can also prevent the acquisition of the data generated by the cookie and related to the use of our Service in addition to the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the available browser plug-in at the following link:&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOYnmJRWUuzFY41tALnDKr8ZJpIA">http://tools.google.com/<wbr />dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</dd>

<p><strong>Google Re/Marketing Services</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>11.1.</dt>
<dd>We use the marketing and remarketing services (hereinafter jointly referred to as the &bdquo;Google Re/Marketing Services&rdquo;) provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (&bdquo;Google&rdquo;).</dd>
<dt>11.2.</dt>
<dd>The Google Re/Marketing Services enable us to display ads for and on our Websites and Service in a more targeted manner so that users are only shown ads which might actually be of interest to them. Where users are, for example, shown ads for products in which they were interested on other websites, this is known as &bdquo;remarketing&rdquo;. For this purpose, as soon as the user accesses our Websites, or other websites on which Google Re/Marketing Services have been activated, Google immediately executes a Google code and so called re/marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also called Web Beacons) are integrated into the Website. With the help of these tags, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the users&rsquo; device (comparable technology can be used instead of cookies). The cookies can be set from various domains, including <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://google.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHJwyEXygIrRfvodxwLrlTTe8c5cw">google.com</a>, <a href="http://doubleclick.net/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://doubleclick.net&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgx6zL3Wlgn9me-hMe8sSdawZJVg">doubleclick.net</a>, <a href="http://invitemedia.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://invitemedia.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPQ5nWpcLEpMqQmPQ5UqTZ71rkrg">invitemedia.com</a>, <a href="http://admeld.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://admeld.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1h0314gQOSeyg9iz1CY2Z-JkWWQ">admeld.com</a>, <a href="http://googlesyndication.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://googlesyndication.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVNtADd4qmGwh2-SYgNjQVBw0Feg">googlesyndication.com</a> or <a href="http://googleadservices.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://googleadservices.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1496247860211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRFN7MTG9gLbJ2PGjr-saH3tG2qA">googleadservices.com</a>. This file keeps a record of which websites the user visits, what content he/she is interested in and which offers he/she has clicked on, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of access and other details about the use of the website content. The users&rsquo; IP address is also recorded, whereby we, within the context of Google Analytics, would like to point out that, within member states of the European Union or in other countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, the IP address is truncated and only transmitted in its entirety to a Google server in the US and truncated there in exceptional cases. The IP address will not be linked with any of the user&rsquo;s data from other services offered by Google. The aforementioned information can also be combined with equivalent information from other sources. If the user visits other websites afterwards, he/she can only be shown the ads that directly reflect his/her interests.</dd>
<dt>11.3.</dt>
<dd>Within the scope of Google Re/Marketing Services, the users&rsquo; data is processed pseudonymously. This means that Google does not, for example, store and process the users&rsquo; name or e-mail address, instead processing the relevant data on the basis of the cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. In other words, from Google&rsquo;s point of view, the ads are managed and displayed for the cookie owner, regardless of who the cookie owner is, rather than for a specifically identified person. This shall not apply where the user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about the users via &bdquo;DoubleClick&rdquo; shall be transmitted to Google and stored on Google&rsquo;s servers in the US.</dd>
<dt>11.4.</dt>
<dd>The online advertising program &bdquo;Google AdWords&rdquo; is just one of the Google Re/Marketing Services used by us. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer is given a different &bdquo;conversion cookie&rdquo;. This means that cookies cannot be tracked on the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained through the cookies serves to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. The AdWords customers find out the total number of users who have clicked on their ad and have been forwarded to a webpage into which a conversion tracking tag has been integrated. However, they do not receive any information that would allow users to be personally identified.</dd>
<dt>11.5.</dt>
<dd>On the basis of Google Re/Marketing Services, we integrate third-party &bdquo;DoubleClick&ldquo; ads. DoubleClick uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to run ads based on users visiting this or other websites.</dd>
<dt>11.6.</dt>
<dd>On the basis of Google Re/Marketing Services, we also integrate third-party &bdquo;AdSense&ldquo; ads. AdSense uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to run ads based on users visiting this or other websites.</dd>
<dt>11.7.</dt>
<dd>With the help of Google optimization services, we also test the user-friendliness and effectiveness of our Websites, e.g. by carrying out A/B tests, whereby users are shown different versions of Websites.</dd>
<dt>11.8.</dt>
<dd>Other Google Re/Marketing Services we use, are the &bdquo;Campaign Manager&rdquo; and the &bdquo;Google Tag Manager&rdquo;, which enable us to integrate other Google Analytics and Marketing Services into our Website (e.g. &bdquo;AdWords&rdquo;, &bdquo;DoubleClick&rdquo; or &bdquo;Google Analytics&rdquo;).</dd>
